# ACS Results - Digital Portfolios for Trades Students 🛠️  

[![Live Demo on Netlify](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-green?logo=netlify)](https://acsresults.netlify.app)  

ACS Results was my **first entrepreneurial project**, launched in my first year of college.  
Its mission: give **blue-collar and vocational students** a professional digital presence through **personalized portfolio websites** - bridging the gap between static resumes and real-world skill showcases.  

It also served as a **business funnel**, leading to my **first paid client (RougeStoryBookWorld)**.
